                    <i>Kentucky</i> boasts a rich tapestry of cultural achievements, sporting events, and industrial contributions,
                    along with its association with legendary American figures. This state has gifted the nation with Bluegrass
                    music, the finest bourbon whiskey, the iconic Kentucky Derby, and the boxing legend Muhammad Ali.

                    Geographically, Kentucky encompasses 40,411 square miles, ranking as the 37th largest state. With a population
                    of approximately 4.55 million residents, it stands as the 26th most populous state, with major urban centers like
                    Lexington (330,000), Louisville (323,000), and Bowling Green (72,200). Kentucky is home to 120 counties.

                    Northern Kentucky shares borders with Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, while its southern boundary meets Tennessee.
                    To the east, it neighbors West Virginia and Virginia, and to the west, it shares its boundary with Missouri.
                    The state capital is Frankfort.

                    Kentucky officially joined the Union on June 1, 1792, as the 15th state. The name "Kentucky" is believed
                    to have originated from the Iroquoian term signifying "meadowland" or "land of tomorrow."

                    This state is characterized by around 670 square miles of water bodies, featuring the Ohio River along its
                    northern border (near Cincinnati) and the Mississippi River on the western edge. Other significant rivers
                    include the Cumberland and the Green. Kentucky boasts several lakes, including Green River Lake, Rough River
                    Lakes, Barkley Lake, and Dewey Lake. Its average elevation stands at 750 feet, with the highest point reaching
                    4,139 feet above sea level. Kentucky spans approximately 380 miles from east to west and 140 miles from north
                    to south. Its climate varies from chilly winters to warm and humid summers, with an annual precipitation of
                    roughly 45 inches and varying snowfall.

                    Kentucky's geography comprises five distinct regions: the Bluegrass Region, the Western Coal Field, the
                    Cumberland Plateau, the Jackson Purchase Region, and the Pennyroyal Region. The Bluegrass Region features
                    low hills known as knobs, covering a significant portion of the area. The Cumberland Plateau forms part
                    of the larger Appalachian Plateau, extending from New York to Alabama. Approximately 40% of Kentucky's
                    land is covered in forests, with the coffee tree serving as the state tree. Kentucky is proud to host
                    59 state parks and four state forests.

                <p class="column" id="col3">
                    As of the 2020 Census, Kentucky's population is estimated at 4.55 million, with a growth rate of 0.47%,
                    ranking 34th among U.S. states. The state has a population density of 110 people per square mile, maintaining
                    a balanced mix of rural and urban dwellers, though urban areas tend to be more prosperous. The population
                    has seen significant growth, with a 200% increase between the 1790 and 1800 Censuses, a trend continuing
                    into the 20th and 21st centuries. Projections suggest a population of 5.3 million by 2050. Gender
                    distribution stands at 50.8% female and 49.2% male, with a median age of 38 years. The majority of the
                    population adheres to Christianity (76%), while 2% follow non-Christian religions, and the rest have no
                    religious affiliation. Ethnically, 82.4% of the population identifies as White, 8% as Black or African American,
                    3% as multiracial, and 1.5% as Asian.

                    Kentucky's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2021 reached $234 billion, contributing approximately 1% to
                    the national GDP, with manufacturing accounting for 18% of its economic activity. The state is renowned
                    for its bourbon whiskey distillation and thoroughbred racehorse breeding. Tobacco production, centered in
                    towns like Owensboro, ranks second only to North Carolina among U.S. producers and has long been a prominent
                    cash crop. Kentucky's chief manufacturing sectors encompass electrical equipment, food products, automobiles,
                    machinery, chemicals, and apparel. Printing, publishing, and tourism have also become key industries. The state
                    is a significant producer of coal, its most valuable mineral, alongside stone, petroleum, and natural gas extraction.

                    In 2021, the median household income in Kentucky averaged $55,573 per year, which is notably lower, by over
                    $14,000, than the national median. The state's economy varies by region, with the Bluegrass and Pennyroyal
                    regions exhibiting greater affluence and diversity in manufacturing and industries. Conversely, the Western
                    Coalfield region relies heavily on coal demand, while Eastern Kentucky is predominantly agricultural and
                    influenced by weather conditions and crop prices. Unfortunately, some of the poorest areas in America are
                    located in Eastern Kentucky. The unemployment rate in Kentucky in 2017, according to the Cabinet for Economic
                    Development, stood at 5.5%.

                    <q cite="~Josiah Espy circa Early 1800's"><i>Lexington is the largest and most wealthy town in Kentucky, or indeed west of the Allegheny Mountains; the main street of Lexington has all
                    the appearance of Market Street in Philadelphia on a busy day ... I would suppose it contains about five hundred dwelling houses [it was closer
                    to three hundred], many of them elegant and three stories high. About thirty brick buildings were then raising, and I have little doubt but that
                    in a few years it will rival, not only in wealth, but in population, the most populous inland town of the United States ... The country around
                    Lexington for many miles in every direction, is equal in beauty and fertility to anything the imagination can paint and is already in a high
                    state of cultivation.</i></q><b><span>--Josiah Espy circa Early 1800's</span></b>

                In Lexington, Kentucky, the need for college athletics runs deep, with the University of Kentucky's athletic program, known as the Kentucky Wildcats,
                taking center stage. The university boasts a total of 22 varsity sports teams, most of which are proud members of the Southeastern Conference, where the
                Wildcats stand as one of its founding institutions. The jewel in their athletic crown is undoubtedly the men's basketball team, a powerhouse in the NCAA
                with a storied history. This basketball program has clinched eight national championships and holds the distinction of being the first to reach the remarkable
                milestone of 2,000 wins.

                Beyond the collegiate atmosphere, Lexington is also home to a vibrant professional sports landscape. One notable presence is the Lexington Counter Clocks,
                formerly known as the Lexington Legends. They are a part of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, an independent league affiliated with Major
                League Baseball. These minor league heroes play their home games at the aptly named Wild Health Field. However, it's worth noting that in 2020, the
                team lost its affiliation with MLB under a new league plan.

                In the realm of soccer, the city proudly hosts the Lexington SC, a member of the third-division professional soccer league known as USL League One.
                Established in 2021, this club currently plays its matches at Toyota Stadium, situated on the campus of Georgetown College. In early 2022, Lexington
                SC set its sights on constructing a dedicated downtown soccer stadium near iconic venues like Rupp Arena and Central Bank Center. With plans for a
                seating capacity of over 6,000, this state-of-the-art stadium is expected to open its doors to eager fans in 2024.

                Lexington's sports history also includes a roster of former professional teams, such as the Kentucky Thoroughblades, Lexington Men O' War, Lexington Bluegrass
                Bandits, Kentucky Horsemen, Bluegrass Warhorses, Bluegrass Stallions, Lexington Colts, and Lexington Legends.

                Lexington's love affair with horses and equestrian events is evident through its world-renowned racing tracks and attractions. Keeneland, steeped in
                tradition since its opening in 1936, remains a hub of live horse racing action, with events held in April and October. The track gained international
                recognition when it hosted the 2015 Breeders' Cup, featuring the iconic Breeders' Cup Classic, won by the legendary Triple Crown victor, American Pharoah.
                Keeneland's legacy extends to its role as the world's largest Thoroughbred auction house, where champions are born. It has been the starting point for 19
                Kentucky Derby winners, 21 Preakness Stakes winners, and 18 Belmont Stakes winners. The Blue Grass Stakes, a key preparation race for the Kentucky Derby
                is a highlight of Keeneland's calendar.

                The Red Mile, Lexington's oldest horse racing track and the second-oldest in the nation, adds to the city's equestrian charm. Here, live harness races take
                place, with horses pulling two-wheeled carts known as sulkies. In a collaborative effort, these two historic tracks announced a partnership in 2014, further
                solidifying Lexington's reputation as a horse racing mecca.

                The Kentucky Horse Park, a relatively recent addition opening in 1978, offers a unique blend of tourist attraction and functioning horse farm. It houses
                notable retired horses like Funny Cide, the 2003 Kentucky Derby champion. The park also hosts the prestigious Rolex Kentucky Three-Day Event, one of the world's
                top-three annual equestrian eventing competitions. Held immediately before the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs in Louisville, this event draws equestrian
                enthusiasts and competitors from around the globe. In a historic moment, Lexington became the first city outside of Europe to host the World Equestrian Games
                in September and October 2010.

                Lexington's sports scene extends beyond the traditional, with niche sports and recreational activities finding their place in the city's heart. The Roller Derby
                of Central Kentucky and Lexington Bike Polo League are testament to this diversity. In 2017, the city proudly hosted the World Hardcourt Bike Polo Championship,
                a fiercely competitive event that drew participants from around the world. Two years earlier, Lexington hosted the North American Hardcourt Bike Polo Championship,
                attracting teams from Canada, Mexico, and the United States.

                One cherished local tradition is the Dirt Bowl, a long-standing basketball tournament organized by Lexington Parks and Recreation at Douglass Park. With roots
                dating back to the early 1970s, this league gained national recognition when Sports Illustrated featured it in 1983, hailing it as one of the premier summer basketball
                leagues in the country. Originally played on dirt courts, which inspired its name, the tournament now takes place on paved surfaces but continues to capture the spirit
                of grassroots basketball in Lexington.

                In Lexington, sports are not just games; they are a way of life, weaving through the city's culture and history, uniting communities, and creating lasting memories for fans and athletes alike.
